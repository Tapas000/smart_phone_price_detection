# Smartphone Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict smartphone prices based on various features such as RAM, battery capacity, processor type, camera specifications, and more. The model utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze the relationship between these factors and the price of a smartphone.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains multiple attributes of smartphones and their corresponding prices. It has been sourced from platforms like Kaggle or manually compiled from various online resources.

## Features
- **RAM**: Memory capacity of the smartphone.
- **Battery**: Battery capacity in mAh.
- **Processor**: Type and speed of the processor.
- **Camera**: Megapixels of front and rear cameras.
- **Storage**: Internal storage capacity.
- **Screen Size**: Display size in inches.
- **Other Specifications**: Additional features like 5G support, refresh rate, etc.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Gather data from sources such as Kaggle or web scraping.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding patterns and relationships in the data.
4. **Model Training**: Training machine learning models (Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like RMSE and RÂ².
6. **Predictions & Insights**: Making price predictions and drawing business insights.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy (Data manipulation)
- Scikit-learn (Machine learning models)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (Development environment)
